👋 Hi, I’m Nelson Lin
👀 I am passionate about the field of AI. In addition to fundamental skills in ML and DL, I have recently started exploring LLM and RAG technologies. Through internships, I have also gained experience in API integration.
🌱 I have experience serving as a team leader, where I developed strong skills in teamwork, problem-solving, communication, and critical thinking. Additionally, I have planned numerous events and taken on the role of event host, reflecting my outgoing and energetic personality.
💞️ I greatly enjoy connecting with others and look forward to discussing AI-related knowledge and technologies. Let’s grow together!
